TBC-Android-Homework-8

the exercise asked to make app based on the provided design.
It took many hours for me to implement design correctly. almost everything is seperate rescource programed to be in right place to match the design.
My app design is not some lazy pictures where elements are drawn together. I took time to program and get all necessary components in order to achieve this design.
I hope checker of this homework will take notice of this. The app is not identicial to one provided with example but its base design is identical. for example. on picture there is apple
sign-in option but I did not put that button in my app. because the exercise asked to create app with same design not with identical functions and other 2 sign-in buttons have same design as the apple one.
